# Motion inside a Gravitational Field

This repository contains codes that were used in the context of the "Computational Astrophysics" course during the Master's degree in *Advanced Studies in Physics* offered in the University of Patras. In this course we mainly used Finite Difference Method to discretize the equations.

We have codes that are used for:

* Study the trajectory of a body inside a gravitational potential and compare different Finite Difference Schemes (Euler and 4th order Runge-Kutta) for obtaining a solution
* Study the stability of trajectories and Lagrange Points
